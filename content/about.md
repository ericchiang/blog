Hi, I'm Eric. I'm an engineer in San Francisco for [CoreOS][coreos] where I work on authentication and authorization systems, contribute to upstream Kubernetes auth systems, and help build a Kubernetes distribution.

I previously built container platforms for deploying and managing machine learning APIs at a New York based startup (YC W15).

Open source:

- [dex][dex]: An OpenID Connect server which federates to other IdPs (LDAP, SAML, etc.)
- [go-oidc][go-oidc]: OpenID Connect support for golang.org/x/oauth2.
- [pup][pup]: Like jq, but for HTML.
- [k8s][k8s-client]: A slimmed down Kubernetes client that uses protobufs.

Talks:
