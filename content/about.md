Hi, I'm Eric. I'm an engineer in San Francisco at [CoreOS][coreos] where I work on auth(n/z) systems and contribute to [Kubernetes][k8s].

I previously built container platforms for machine learning APIs at a New York based startup.

Open source:

- [dex][dex]: an OpenID Connect server which federates to other IdPs (LDAP, SAML, etc.)
- [pup][pup]: like jq, but for HTML.

Talks:

- [_Kubernetes Auth and Acess Control_][k8s-auth] (video, 41 min): KubeCon October, 2016
